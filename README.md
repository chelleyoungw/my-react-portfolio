## Description

An online portfolio to display my projects that were created during the edX MERN Full Stack Bootcamp, hosted by The University of Texas at Austin. This is a live site and will be updated with more projects and career information. This site is also a way to connect with other programmers in the community and show off my skills I have learned and cultivated into my own personal brand. The app is deployed using Netlify.
